`🛠️` **updated command** </sell:1106915320763011149>
> - *You can now sell dupes using `/sell` `setid:`*
> - *An option has been added called `dupesleft`, **this is to tell Heejin how many dupes you want to keep of each GID in the set***
> - *You can use commas "," to sell multiple `uid` and `setid` at once
>  - Example: `/sell` `uid:abc123, 123abc` `setid:123, 321, 456`*
> - *The limit to selling, due to Discord's max embed size, has had a workaround by only showing card names when there's 10 or less*
> - ***NOTE**: If you don't give a number for `dupesleft`, **the default is to keep 0 dupes of each GID***
> - ***NOTE**: Selling using `setid` ignores the main card, **`setid` is only used to sell dupes***
